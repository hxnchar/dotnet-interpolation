# DotNet Course Work (H1'21)
## Assignment ✍️
I had to design and implement a software to interpolate functions in Newtol and linear methods. 
The input data for this work is at least 2 points, whose coordinates must be written in the following form:

`(x1; y1)`

`(x2; y2)`

...

`(xn-1; yn-1)`

`(xn; yn)`

`x?`

where `(xn; yn)` are data points, `x?` is the interpolation node (the point at which the program must calculate the approximate value of the function).
The software must process a list of point coordinates.
To solve the problem, you need to enter a minimum of 2 known points and the coordinates of the unknown.
The coordinates can be entered using the import of a text file or by adding each point manually.
The output data for this work is the approximate value of the function at the specified point.

## Final mark: 87/100
